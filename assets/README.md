# Horiseon Social Media Marketing Refactoring
This project is an exercise in refactoring HTML and CSS for readability and accessibility purposes. I aim to make the site easier to understand for those with visual impairments while also providing adequate descriptors for those who might be experiencing connectivity issues. In addition, I also aim to optimize the site for seach engines. This is especially important considering the client specializes in SEO marketing strategies.
